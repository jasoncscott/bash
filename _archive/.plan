    I started at Method LA on Monday, 23 February 2015.
    
    On Wednesday, 25 February 2015, I wrote this .plan file to see how many people still use the "finger" command (I did the same thing previously at DreamWorks Animation SKG and Rhythm & Hues Studios).
    
    If you read this "Plan" and IM or e-mail me, you will have your name placed in this file to be immortalized as long as I am with the company (people USED to receive $5.00 at the other companies, but I'm too cheap now).
